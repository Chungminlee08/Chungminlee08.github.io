Thanks for visiting my website. I am Chungmin Lee, an undergraduate student double majoring in applied statistics and history(general) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), Seoul, Korea. After finishing the first semester of my junior year, I moved to East lansing, MI and studied at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) as an exchange student for an academic year. It was a time when my heart was filled with the joy of learning new things. Moreover, I was so fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io/) there.

My research interests include computer experiment, uncertainty quantification, big data, machine learning, deep learning, multi-fidelity simulation, applied mathematics in the field of industrial/engineering statistics, and the applications of statistics in finance/biotechnology industry.

Beyond my research, one of my greatest personal passions is tennis. Though not an expert, I love stepping onto the court and playing in any season. I also find joy in flowering and photography, feeling a deep sense of peace when sharing a silent conversation with flowers. Additionally, I am an amateur violinist and gayageum player.
